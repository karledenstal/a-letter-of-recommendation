# A Letter of Recommendation

Makes it so you need to have a letter of recommendation from a court wizard to be able to even attempt joining the College of Winterhold. You can get a letter of recommendation by being a thane, completing quests related to the court wizard, or of course by bribing, persuading and intimidating the correct people. Adds a new dimension to the College of Winterhold questline.

This mod comes in two versions, one that requires you to have a letter of recommendation from each Court Wizard (The normal version), and one that only requires you to have one letter of recommendation from any Court Wizard (the easy version).

## Farengar Secret-Fire

You can gain a letter of recommendation from Farengar by either being a thane of Whiterun and completing the "Bleak Falls Barrow" quest. This is technically the easiest way to get one due to you have to do these things in the Main Quest, thus Farengar requires higher magic skills to give you a letter of recommendation.

## Wylandriah

You can gain a letter of recommendation from Wylandriah by either being a thane of Riften and completing the "Hunt and Gather" quest. She's forgetful, so there are other options here to get a letter of recommendation from her, depending on your skills and morals.

## Sybille Stentor

You can gain a letter of recommendation from Sybille by completing the quest "The Wolf Queen Awakened" or being a thane of Haafingar. Sybille is more difficult to get a recommendation from, and bribing, persuading or intimidating her will be more difficult than the other court wizards.

## Calcelmo

You can gain a letter of recommendation from Calcelmo by completing the quests "Nimhe, the Poisoned One" and "The Lost Expedition". This is because Calcelmo generally doesn't give a crap if you're the thane or not.

## Madena

You can gain a letter of recommendation from Madena by completing the quest "Waking Nightmare". If you try and get a letter of recommendation from her before completing this quest, she will tell you to go away, since the nightmares are making her tired and she doesn't want to deal with you.

## Wuunferth the Unliving

You can gain a letter of recommendation from Wuunferth by completing "Blood on the Ice! quest, however if you suspected him and got him locked up, you'll need to convince him to give you one.

## Nelacar

You can gain a letter of recommendation from Nelacar if you complete the quest "Azura's Star" in his favor. This recommendation may or may not be accepted by the College of Winterhold.

## Falion

You can gain a letter of recommendation from Falion by blackmailing him during the quest "Falion's Secret". This will offer a special dialogue option to get a letter of recommendation from him, as well as an alternate ending where you don't report Falion. This recommendation may or may not be accepted by the College of Winterhold.
