# A Letter of Recommendation

Makes it so you need to have a letter of recommendation from a court wizard to be able to even attempt joining the College of Winterhold. You can get a letter of recommendation by being a thane, completing quests related to the court wizard, or of course by bribing, persuading and intimidating the correct people. Adds a new dimension to the College of Winterhold questline.

There are plenty of ways to get the letters. Completing the required quests and/or being a thane is the "proper" way, but if your character is so inclined, you can try both bribing and persuading. And if that doesn't work, maybe you could try a little bit of pickpocketing.

## Farengar Secret-Fire

You can gain a letter of recommendation from Farengar by either being a thane of Whiterun and completing the "Bleak Falls Barrow" quest. You can skip those and try and bribe or persuade him to give you one.

	**Player has not completed Bleak Falls Barrow OR is a thane**

	> "You wish to join the College? I'm afraid I don't know you well enough to make a recommendation, perhaps if you were to assist me with my research..."

	- Can't you make an exception? (persuade)

		**Successful**

		> "Well, you seem to be a promising student. I'll make an exception this time. Here's your letter."

	**Player has completed Bleak Falls Barrow OR is a thane**

	> "A prospective student, are you? With the help you've provided to me, I'd be happy to write one for you."

## Wylandriah

You can gain a letter of recommendation from Wylandriah by either being a thane of Riften and completing the "Hunt and Gather" quest. She's forgetful, so there are other options here to get a letter of recommendation from her, depending on your skills and morals.

## Sybille Stentor

## Madena

You can gain a letter of recommendation from Madena by completing the quest "Waking Nightmare". If you try and get a letter of recommendation from her before completing this quest, she will tell you to go away, since the nightmares are making her tired and she doesn't want to deal with you.

- I need a letter of recommendation.

	**Player completed Waking Nightmare**

	- Can't you find some time? (persuade)

		**Failed**

		> "No, time is of the essence. I can't help you."

		**Success**

		> "If it will get you to leave me alone, fine. Here you go."

	- Would this gold change your mind? (bribe)

		**Failed**

	- Nevermind.

		> "Good. I'm busy with the investigation."

## Nelacar

Nelacar was asked to leave the College due to his experiments, and because of it he doesn't hold a lot of love for the College. If you have completed the quest "The Black Star" and you brought the star to him instead of Azura, he will happily give you falsified letters of recommendations from the other court wizards. You can also pay him to falsify the letters.

*Continuation from "You're with the college?" dialogue*

- Do you know how I can get a letter of recommendation?

	> "You would need to ask each of the court wizards. I'm afraid I can't help you with that."

	- Is there no other way?

	> "Well, there is one thing. If you're willing to pay, I could forge a letter from each of them."

	- How much?

	**Player has not completed the Black Star**

	> "A fair price. 5000 gold. I'll need the money up front, of course."

	**Player has the Black Star**

	> "Nothing. Consider it a gift for dealing with Malyn for me."

	- I'll take it.

		> "Excellent. I'll get started right away. See me tomorrow and I'll have them ready for you."

	- I don't have that kind of money.

		> "Well, I'm afraid I can't help you then."

	- Can you not sweeten the deal a little? (persuade)

		**Failed**

		> "I'm afraid not. I'm not in the business of giving away free favors."

		**Success**

		> "Fine, I'll lower the price to 3000 gold. But that's as low as I can go."
