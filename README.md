# A Letter of Recommendation

Makes it so you need to have a letter of recommendation from a court wizard to be able to even attempt joining the College of Winterhold. You can get a letter of recommendation by being a thane, completing quests related to the court wizard, or of course by bribing, persuading and intimidating the correct people. Adds a new dimension to the College of Winterhold questline.

There are plenty of ways to get the letters. Completing the required quests and/or being a thane is the "proper" way, but if your character is so inclined, you can try both bribing and persuading. And if that doesn't work, maybe you could try a little bit of pickpocketing.

Start the quest by talking to Faralda on the bridge to the College in Winterhold.

> "Not just anyone is allowed inside. In order to be considered, you need to get recommendations from the court wizards of the holds of Skyrim."

- How can I get a recommendation?

> "That's up to the court wizard to decide. They always need help with their various projects, so they might be willing to give you a recommendation if you assist them."

- Why do I need a recommendation?

> "It's no secret that the College's reputation in Skyrim is tainted. The people have come to fear us more than they do the Thalmor. This is done to protect the College, and the world, from those who would abuse our power."

- Is there any other way to get a recommendation?

> "If you can convince the court wizard that you are worthy, I'm sure they'd be willing to give you a recommendation. Or, if you're the thane of a hold, you may be able to convince them to give you one."

## Farengar Secret-Fire

You can gain a letter of recommendation from Farengar by either being a thane of Whiterun and completing the "Bleak Falls Barrow" quest. You can skip those and try and bribe or persuade him to give you one.

	**Player has not completed Bleak Falls Barrow OR is a thane**

	> "I don't have time for this. I'm busy doing important research about the dragons."

	- Can't you make an exception? (persuade)

		**Successful**

		> "Well, you seem to be a promising student. I'll make an exception this time. Here's your letter."

		**Failed**

		> "No, sorry. I'm afraid I can't help you."

	- Would this gold change your mind? (bribe)

		**Successful**

		> "A little coin greases the wheels."

		**Failed**

		> "Nah, I don't think so."

	**Player has completed Bleak Falls Barrow OR is a thane**

	> "Ah yes. Here you go."

## Wylandriah

You can gain a letter of recommendation from Wylandriah by either being a thane of Riften and completing the "Hunt and Gather" quest. She's forgetful, so there are other options here to get a letter of recommendation from her, depending on your skills and morals.

- I need a letter of recommendation.

	**Player has completed Hunt and Gather OR is a thane of the Rift**

	> "Of course, I'd be happy to write one for you. Let's see now... who shall I make it out to? Here you go."

## Sybille Stentor

You can gain a letter of recommendation from Sybille by completing the quest "The Wolf Queen Awakened" or being a thane of Haafingar. Sybille is more difficult to get a recommendation from, and bribing, persuading or intimidating her will be more difficult than the other court wizards.

- I need a letter of recommendation.

	**Player is thane of Haafingar or completed The Wolf Queen Awakened**

	> "Here you go."

	**Player is not thane of Haafingar and has not completed The Wolf Queen Awakened**

		**Successful**

		> "Very well. Here you go."

## Calcelmo

You can gain a letter of recommendation from Calcelmo by completing the quests "Nimhe, the Poisoned One" and "The Lost Expedition". This is because Calcelmo generally doesn't give a crap if you're the thane or not.

- I need a letter of recommendation.

	**Player completed Nimhe, The Poisoned One**

	> "Fine fine, I'll write you a letter. Here you go."

	**Player has NOT completed Nimhe, The Poisoned One**

	> "I don't have time for this. I'm busy doing important research about the Dwemer. That blasted spider is blocking my way to the ruins."

	- Can't you make an exception? (persuade)

		**Failed**

		> "Nah, I don't think so."

		**Success**

		> "If it will get you out of my hair, fine. Here's you go."

	- Would this gold change your mind? (bribe)

		**Failed**

		> "Nah, I don't think so."

		**Success**

		> "That would help my research. Fine. Here you go."

## Madena

You can gain a letter of recommendation from Madena by completing the quest "Waking Nightmare". If you try and get a letter of recommendation from her before completing this quest, she will tell you to go away, since the nightmares are making her tired and she doesn't want to deal with you.

- I need a letter of recommendation.

	**Player completed Waking Nightmare**

	> "Of course, I'd be happy to write one for you. Here you go."

	**Player has NOT completed Waking Nightmare**

	> "I'm sorry, I'm just so tired. I can't help you right now."

## Wuunferth the Unliving

You can gain a letter of recommendation from Wuunferth by completing "Blood on the Ice" quest. If you try and get a letter of recommendation from him before completing this quest, he will tell you to go away, since he's busy with the investigation.

- I need a letter of recommendation.

	**Player completed Blood on the Ice**

	> "Here you go."

	**Player has NOT Blood on the Ice**

	> "I don't have time for this. There's a killer on the loose."

	- Can't you find some time? (persuade)

		**Failed**

		> "No, time is of the essence. I can't help you."

		**Success**

		> "If it will get you to leave me alone, fine. Here you go."

	- Would this gold change your mind? (bribe)

		**Failed**

		> "I'm not interested in your money."

		**Success**

		> "Gold? I suppose I could use some. Fine. Here you go."

	- Nevermind.

		> "Good. I'm busy with the investigation."

## Nelacar

Nelacar was asked to leave the College due to his experiments, and because of it he doesn't hold a lot of love for the College. If you have completed the quest "The Black Star" and you brought the star to him instead of Azura, he will happily give you falsified letters of recommendations from the other court wizards. You can also pay him to falsify the letters.

- About the College...

	> "Yes?"

- How I can get a letter of recommendation?

	> "You would need to ask each of the court wizards. I'm afraid I can't help you with that."

	- Is there no other way?

	> "Well, there is one thing. If you're willing to pay, I could forge a letter from each of them."

	- How much?

	**Player has not completed the Black Star**

	> "5000 gold. I'll need the money up front, of course."

	**Player has the Black Star**

	> "Nothing. Consider it a gift for dealing with Malyn for me."

	- I'll take it.

		> "I'll get started right away. See me tomorrow and I'll have them ready for you."

	- I don't have that kind of money.

		> "Well, I'm afraid I can't help you then."

	- Can you not sweeten the deal a little? (persuade)

		**Failed**

		> "I'm afraid not. I'm not in the business of giving away free favors."

		**Success**

		> "Fine, I'll lower the price to 3000 gold. But that's as low as I can go."
